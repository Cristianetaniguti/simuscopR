Description: Wrap-up R package to coordinate SimusCop simulations. 
             Also, here we present a easy conversion of VCF files 
             in variations and snp files for SimuSCoP simuReads. 
             This tools is useful if you want to simulate Illumina 
             reads based on empirical variations already stored in a VCF file.
